Code examples and other resources for "Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"

This repository contains the code and hyperparameter values necessary to reproduce the results of 
"Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmoiMbCb). 
Everything is anonymous because the paper is still under review.

The code examples correspond specifically to one of the many experiments presented in the paper, but 
they can easily be modified to reflect any of the other experiments by changing datasets and using
the hyperparameters in `hyper.txt`.
